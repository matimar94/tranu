# Tranu

## Cross platform multimedia library for python

### About:
Develop minimal games/applications with a library that abstracts multiple media systems to a simple wrapper.

Tranu was designed since the start with both the web and desktop in mind, with mobile as a future possibility.

Tranu is structured to allow you to wrap multiple libraries, no matter if they are all for desktop or web and choose the best one for your needs.

### Targets:
- Web via Transcrypt + Canvas
- Desktop via PySDL2

### Not included
- Mobile target (although PySDL2 + p4a should help)
